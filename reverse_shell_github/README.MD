Under "hack.ps1", change the respective fields to the listeners ip and port.

Upload your new hack.ps1 to the internet, apache server, whatever, just make sure you have a link. 

Then in the .ino script, change the link that I provided with your own. 

On the attacking machine, use "nc -lvp PORT', of course changing out port to match the one specified under hack.ps1.

set up a listener with netcat, armitage, kage, metasploit, or whatever you want!
